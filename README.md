# 🗂️Project Overview

**Note:** This only a functional prototype containing only the required core functionalities for this part of the POE. 

## 📝What our application does?
My application allows farmers to add the products that they supply, to their profiles. Also, my application allows employees to view all the products that farmers supply as well as allowing employees to add farmers and manage their accounts. 

## 👤Who is our application intended for?
My application is intended for farmers as it allows to them add products that they supply to their profiles.

## 🧩Chosen Architecture and Design Patterns
For our architecture pattern, we selected the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.
As for our design pattern, we selected the Observer pattern.

## 🗄️Chosen Database
### What database are we using?
I am using a SQL database to store farmer products as well as users.

### Why did I choose SQL database?
I chose to create a SQL database since I am already quite familiar with its relational nature so I didn't struggle when creating tables, storing data within them as well as integrating the database with my app.
I also know my way around SQL Management Studio (which is recommended for managing a SQL database).

# 🧑‍💻User Experience
## How we considered User Experience (UX) in the design of our app?
For the css theme, I decided to replace the default theme with a custom dark theme. Additionally, I have ensured that all the buttons used in the application are easy to see from a glance so farmers don't have to struggle. To further assist farmers as well as employees, I have also included simple instructions for each respective type of user on the pages that they currently have access to.
