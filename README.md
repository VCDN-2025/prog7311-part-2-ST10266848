## Who is our application intended for?

# User Experience
## How we considered User Experience (UX) in the design of our app?
For the css theme, I decided to replace the default theme with a custom dark theme. Additionally, I have ensured that all the buttons used in the application are easy to see from a glance so farmers don't have to struggle. To further assist farmers as well as employees, I have also included simple instructions for each respective type of user on the pages that they currently have access to.
